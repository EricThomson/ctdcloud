# CTD Cloud Curriculum Development Docs
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible cloud computing teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This informal space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for Python 200. Student facing-material will ultimately be hosted separately at Code the Dream. 

## Background and motivation
Cloud computing is a massive domain that *easily* fill an entire year of instruction. In Python 200, we have four weeks, so we need to focus in on topics relevant to Python and data engineering.

Unlike machine learning and AI workflows, cloud computing is often not mainly about writing code. Much of it involves understanding and connecting to infrastructure and services, and working with GUIs. Therefore, for this workspace we are using MkDocs and Markdown-based guides (and code where needed) instead of Jupyter notebooks.

One challenge with teaching cloud concepts is that the terminology and UI are constantly changing. Be cautious about recording long videos (they are hard to edit), and be prepared to re-take screenshots -- they can easily go out of date within a few months. This is just the way of the cloud. :laughing: :cloud:

## Main Workflows
After giving a general introduction to cloud computing in Week 1, we will provide a hands-on introduction to cloud computing by building projects in Azure each week. 

- [Week 1: Hello Cloud](week1.md): Intro to general cloud concepts, and working with the Azure CLI to deploy python modules.
- [Week 2: AI in the Cloud](week2.md): Learn how to spin up cloud compute resources and deploy an AI application.
- [Week 3: ML in the Cloud](week3.md): Introduction to cloud-based storage (Blob Storage) in the context of running ML pipelines. 
- [Week 4: ETL Pipelines](week4.md): Work with database management systems in the context of building ETL pipelines.
