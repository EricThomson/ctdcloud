# Week 1: Hello Cloud

Week 1 will focus on introducing core cloud concepts and getting started using Azure. Here we will focus on answer questions about why cloud computing is useful (e.g., if you have 5TB of data, you can't bring the data to you, you want to bring yourself to the data). Also, in Python 100 we haven't taught them how to connect to remote servers via SSH and code, so this is a great opportunity to teach these skills that are taken for granted in industry. (Tom Arns will help with this dimension). 

###  Focus
- Introduction to core cloud concepts (compute, storage, etc etc)
- Overview of Azure as a platform
- Using the command line to interact with cloud resources
- Understand when and when not to use cloud and how to estimate cloud cost


### Hands-On Activities
- Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) 
- Open and configure a cloud shell environment
- Run Python code via the Azure CLI (use VS Code SSH)
- Explore cloud compute options like virtual machines and containers
- Estimate cost of a few simple use case with Azure cost calculator

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this week, students will be able to:

- Describe fundamental cloud concepts: **compute**, **storage**, **networking**
- Navigate the Azure portal confidently
- Know how to estimate cloud cost
-  Use the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) to:
  - Authenticate using shared credentials
  - Deploy and run simple Python modules
  - Inspect and manage basic resources and estimate cost

### Resources
- [Azure Fundamentals (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
- [Azure CLI Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)
- [What is Cloud Computing? (Microsoft)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing/)
- [Azure Cost Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

### Instructor Notes
Encourage students to treat this week as *orientation* â€” they will likely feel a bit overwhelmed the cloud is basically a fractal structure, they aren't expected to learn it all. None of us know it all. We are planning to provide a *curated guide* that focuses on a key subset of topics.

- Ensure all students have access to the shared credentials before the session.
- Monitor resource (test this multiple times before running with students).
- Find link to classic reddit posts where people have spent 20k in one night by accident :D
