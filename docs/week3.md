# Week 3: ML in the Cloud
This week, weâ€™ll explore how cloud-based storage and machine learning platforms support ML workflows. Students will train and deploy an image classifier using both low-code and code-first tools. 

### Focus
- Learn about different types of cloud storage.
    - Databricks hive metastore
    - Azure Blob Storage
- Learn how cloud storage fits into ML workflows
- Understand the differences between low-code and high-code approaches
- Get hands-on experience with multiple Azure ML tools
- Know how to visualize data with cloud tools

### Hands-On Activities
- Upload an image dataset to Azure Blob Storage
- Build a classifier using:
    - Azure ML Designer (low-code drag-and-drop)
    - Azure ML SDK (Python-based code-first)
    - Databricks AutoML
- Compare pipeline transparency, usability, and deployment steps
- Visualize features, accuracy, and other metrics with PowerBI on Azure
- Run inference on new images in the cloud

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this week, students will be able to:

- Explain the role of cloud storage in ML workflows
- Upload and manage image data using Blob Storage
- Build and deploy an ML model using Azure ML Designer
- Use the Azure ML SDK to run inference in Python
- Reflect on the trade-offs between low-code and code-first ML development:
    - Usability
    - Flexibility
    - Cost and compute usage
- Know how work with features and metrics with data visualization tools

### Instructor Notes
We will need to decide whether students will build their own pipelines or collaborate in small groups.
