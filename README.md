# Code the Dream Cloud Workspace
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible cloud computing teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for Python 200. Student facing-material will be hosted separately at Code the Dream. 

## Plan
After giving a general introduction to cloud computing in Week 1, we will provide a hands-on introduction to cloud computing by building projects in Azure each week. For more detailed discussion, please [see the docs](https://ctdcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!

- **Week 1: Hello Cloud**: Intro to general cloud concepts, and working with the Azure CLI to deploy python modules.
- **Week 2: AI in the Cloud**: Learn how to spin up cloud compute resources and deploy an AI application.
- **Week 3: ML in the Cloud**: Introduction to cloud-based storage in the context of running ML pipelines. 
- **Week 4: ETL Pipelines**: Work with database management systems in the context of building ETL pipelines.
